# 💻 **Fallout WPF — Multi-Purpose Themed Application**

**Fallout WPF** is a multi-purpose application developed in **C#** using **WPF**, inspired by the iconic *Fallout* game universe.  
As my first project in C#, it provided a deep exploration of key programming concepts, ranging from graphical interface design and event handling to local database integration and game logic implementation.

The project features a fully themed interface styled after the *Pip-Boy* device and combines several interactive components into one cohesive experience.
